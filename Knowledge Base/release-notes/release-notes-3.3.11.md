# Release notes edition 3.3.11

Release date: 18 December 2024  
Version: v3

Here's the latest summary of what's new and improved in Zudello, as well as what we resolved in the latest release.

# New and improved

### Bulk submission for transactions

We've enhanced the document submission process to make it even faster when working with multiple documents.

You can now select multiple documents (from either table or list view) and submit them all at once:

- A summary screen shows you all selected transactions before submission
- You can minimise the bulk submission to run in the background while you continue working on other tasks
- When complete, Zudello provides a summary of successful and failed submissions
- For failed submissions, you can open the transactions to review and resolve any issues

This feature helps you process large volumes of documents more efficiently, saving you time and reducing manual effort.

### Units of measure in sales forms

Units of measure help you track quantities accurately across your business. We've expanded this functionality to include sales documents, allowing you to:

- Add units of measure fields to your sales module forms
- Maintain consistency between purchasing and sales modules
- Track quantities more precisely across all transactions

### Date and time filtering for automation logs

Automation logs help you track and troubleshoot your automated processes in Zudello. You can now specify both date and time when filtering the automation log, making it easier to:

- Isolate specific events
- Troubleshoot automation issues more efficiently
- Find the exact information you need

# Resolutions

We're constantly working to refine Zudello functionality and ensure that we address any issues as soon as possible. As part of this release, we've made the following resolutions and improvements:

- Units of measure can now be added to forms in the sales module
- You can now specify a date and time when filtering the automation log to assist in troubleshooting automation issues
- Required fields are now shown with a less intrusive asterisk (\*) when transactions are created, and will only show error banners if they are empty after a save or refresh
- We resolved an issue where standard users were unable to view the country list
- We fixed a navigation issue where users sometimes encountered a blank search page when moving through multiple pages
- We resolved an issue that prevented adding mileage expenses when clicking the add expenses button on a reimbursement claim
- We improved the messaging for documents in the unclassified section to better reflect their current status
