# Release notes edition 3.4.7

Release date: 12 March 2025  
Version: v3

Here's the latest summary of what's new and improved in Zudello, as well as what we resolved in the latest release.

## New and improved

### Place order (beta release)

Purchase order management helps you track orders with suppliers from creation through to fulfilment. We've introduced a new [**Place order**](../purchasing-module/placing-a-purchase-order.md) action for purchase orders to streamline your ordering process.

The new **Place order** action is available for purchase orders in **Pending** status and offers two options:

- **Place and send**
	- Generates an updated PDF of the purchase order
    - Sends the PDF to your supplier via email
    - Updates the status to **Placed**
    - Records who placed the order and when
 
- **Place without emailing**    
    - Generates an updated PDF of the purchase order
    - Doesn't send an email to the supplier
    - Updates the status to **Placed**
    - Records who placed the order and when

This new functionality gives you the flexibility to choose whether to email suppliers from within Zudello, or handle communication separately. It also helps you track exactly when orders were placed and by whom, giving you a comprehensive audit trail.

## Resolutions

We're constantly working to refine Zudello functionality and ensure that we address any issues as soon as possible. As part of this release, we've made the following resolutions and improvements:

- We've improved our export system so that large CSV exports no longer impact performance in other areas of the system
- We've resolved an issue where delegation of authority (DOA) approvals that go straight to  the user with a sufficient limit weren't running correctly when the document total (rather than the sum of line totals) was selected as the method to evaluate limits
