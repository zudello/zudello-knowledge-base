Release date: 13 February 2025  
Version: v3

Here's the latest summary of what's new and improved in Zudello, as well as what we resolved in the latest release.

## New and improved

### Customer address selection

We've enhanced our address functionality to give you more flexibility when working with customer addresses in the sales module. We've introduced new address selection options that make it easier to find the right customer addresses.

When the **Customer address** option is selected for your team:
- The address drop-down will automatically filter to show only addresses for the customer selected on the transaction
- If no customer is selected, all customer addresses will be available
- When you select an address, all address fields on the transaction will be automatically filled

When the **Team address** option is selected:
- Any addresses configured for your team will be displayed in the drop-down
- When you select an address, all address fields on the transaction will be automatically filled

Please reach out to support@zudello.com to discuss enabling these settings for your team.

We continuously work to make Zudello faster and more efficient. In this release:

- We've improved system performance when opening transactions with large number of allocations
- We've made various other performance enhancements across the platform
