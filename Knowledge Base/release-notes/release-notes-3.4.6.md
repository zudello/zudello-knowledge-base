# Release notes edition 3.4.6

Release date: 5 March 2025  
Version: v3

Here's the latest summary of what's new and improved in Zudello, as well as what we resolved in the latest release.

## New and improved

### Branding update

Zudello has had a refresh! We've updated our logo across all teams. You'll see our new look throughout the platform as you continue to use Zudello.

### Performance improvements

We continuously work to make Zudello faster and more efficient. In this release, we've implemented system-wide caching for frequently used resources, such as document types, field settings, and statuses. This enhancement helps the system access information more quickly, resulting in faster response times and a smoother user experience.
### Backend validation (Beta release)

Data validation helps ensure information is accurate and complete before documents are processed. Selected teams have been opted into our new backend validations feature, which provides enhanced validation capabilities.

The new validation system provides several benefits:

- View validation errors at the submodule level, without needing to open individual documents
- Identify potential issues earlier in your document processing workflow
- Receive clearer feedback about what needs to be corrected

## Resolutions

We're constantly working to refine Zudello functionality and ensure that we address any issues as soon as possible. As part of this release, we've made the following resolutions and improvements:

- We've resolved an issue where replies to system-generated emails were failing due to incorrect email domain settings
- We've fixed an issue where exports could not send notifications
- We've resolved an issue where supplier default business rules (coding) couldn't be configured due to dependency conflicts
