# Release notes edition 3.4.5

Release date: 19 February 2025  
Version: v3

Here's the latest summary of what's new and improved in Zudello, as well as what we resolved in the latest release.

## New and improved

### Document extraction improvements

We've made a number of extraction improvements as part of our ongoing commitment to increase both the speed and accuracy of our document extraction process. These enhancements help ensure that more of your document data is correctly identified and populated into the appropriate fields, saving you time and reducing the need for manual corrections.

## Resolutions

We're constantly working to refine Zudello functionality and ensure that we address any issues as soon as possible. As part of this release, we've made the following resolutions and improvements:

- We've resolved an issue where inbox template placeholders were not displayed correctly
- We've fixed an issue where the **Skip sentence if no match** option was ignored when delegation of authority (DOA) approvals were set to start from the user with a sufficient limit
- We've removed several legacy endpoints to improve overall system performance
- We've improved error responses when using the send email functionality, providing more context as to why an email could not be sent
