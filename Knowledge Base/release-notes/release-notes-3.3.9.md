# Release notes edition 3.3.9

Release date: 26 November 2024  
Version: v3

Here's the latest summary of what's new and improved in Zudello, as well as what we resolved in the latest release.

# New and improved

### Expanded price comparison options

Previously, Zudello could only compare invoice prices to purchase order prices when matching documents. You can now choose to compare the unit price of line items to one of the following:

- The linked item's purchase price
- The linked item's sell price

These options help you quickly identify pricing discrepancies across your transactions and ensure you're receiving the correct pricing from suppliers or offering the correct pricing to customers.

Contact Zudello support to discuss enabling this feature for your organisation.

## Bulk quick actions

Quick actions help you perform common tasks with a single click. For ease of use, quick actions are now available as bulk actions, allowing you to run the same quick action on multiple records at once. This saves time when you need to perform the same action on many documents at once. 

The following limitations apply when running quick actions in bulk:

- Quick actions can only be executed against resources in editable statuses
- Bulk quick actions are not available via the **All** or **Requests** submodule
- Users must be authorised to list quick actions in order to see and execute them

# Resolutions

- We've added additional tracing to identify and resolve document extraction errors more efficiently.
