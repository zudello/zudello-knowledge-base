# Release notes edition 3.4.9

Release date: 26 March 2025  
Version: v3

Here's the latest summary of what's new and improved in Zudello, as well as what we resolved in the latest release.

## New and improved

### Completed timestamp

Document audit trails help you track when key actions occur throughout your document lifecycle. We've enhanced our audit capabilities by adding a completed timestamp that records exactly when a document moves to a complete-type status.

When a document moves into a complete-type status:

- The system automatically records the current date and time
- This timestamp remains with the document as part of its audit history
- The timestamp won't change if the document moves between different complete-type statuses

This enhancement provides a more comprehensive audit trail, making it easier to track when documents were finalised.

### Bulk approve & bulk submit (Beta release)

Processing multiple documents efficiently is key to streamlining your workflow. We've introduced two powerful new bulk actions to help you process documents faster.

#### Bulk submit

You can now select multiple documents from either table or list view and submit them all at once:

- A summary screen shows you all selected transactions before submission
- You can minimise the bulk submission to run in the background while you continue working on other tasks
- When complete, Zudello provides a summary of successful and failed submissions
- For failed submissions, you can open the transactions to review and resolve any issues

#### Bulk approve

You can now select multiple documents awaiting your approval and approve them all at once:

- A summary screen shows you all selected transactions before approval
- You can minimise the bulk approval to run in the background while you continue working on other tasks
- When complete, Zudello provides a summary of successful and failed approvals
- Only documents that require your approval and have no validation errors will be processed

These features are currently in beta and only available for teams with backend validation enabled. Reach out to support@zudello.com to discuss enabling these features for your team.

### Budgets (Beta release)

Budget management helps you control spending and ensure procurement and AP costs stay within defined limits. We've launched a new budgets feature that gives you powerful capabilities to track and manage expenditure, including the ability to:

- Create and edit budgets with designated budget owners who are responsible for approving exceptions
- Track and display budget information against transactions
- Receive proactive warnings when transactions exceed budget limits
- Configure budget reasons for reporting on budget exceptions
- Route transactions for additional approval when they exceed budget limits
- Configure which modules, submodules, and statuses count toward which budget categories

The budgets feature currently in beta and only available for a selected number of teams. Reach out to support@zudello.com to discuss enabling this feature for your team.

### Performance improvements

We continuously work to make Zudello faster and more efficient. In this release, we've improved the speed of our standard submodule views by approximately three times, allowing you to navigate through your documents more quickly.

## Resolutions

We're constantly working to refine Zudello functionality and ensure that we address any issues as soon as possible. As part of this release, we've made the following resolutions and improvements:

- We've resolved an issue where item alternatives would not load when the **Is preferred** option was included in the form
- We've removed all request submodules from the **Submodule** drop-down menu when converting documents
