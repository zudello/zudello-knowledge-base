# Release notes edition 3.3.10

Release date: 11 December 2024  
Version: v3

Here's the latest summary of what's new and improved in Zudello, as well as what we resolved in the latest release.

# New and improved

### Performance enhancements

We've made significant performance improvements across the platform:

- Opening documents is now approximately 40% faster, allowing you to review information more quickly
- Saving documents is also around 40% faster, reducing the time you spend waiting for changes to be processed

These improvements help you handle more documents in less time, so you can focus on the tasks that matter most to your business.

### Enhanced bank account validation

Bank account validation compares bank details on documents against the information stored in your system, to ensure you always pay to the right account.

We've made the following enhancements to our bank account validation to improve security and reduce the potential for errors:

- Zudello now flags discrepancies only when account information is available on both the document and the supplier/customer record, reducing the potential for incorrect errors
- Users must resolve bank account validation errors before submitting documents, ensuring any discrepancies are addressed immediately
- Special characters and spaces are automatically removed during comparisons to ensure accuracy

### Document classification improvements

Document classification helps Zudello organise your documents into the correct submodules for processing. We've made several improvements to document classification:

- Documents that encounter issues during extraction now appear in a new Classification submodule, making them easier to find and manage
- The Classification submodule only appears when there are documents that need review, keeping your interface clean and focused
- You can review these documents and select the correct submodule for processing

# Resolutions

- We've resolved an issue where document views didn't refresh correctly when users changed the selected statuses
  
- We've fixed a display issue with the Group Membership Management page where inactive users weren't correctly shown as inactive in single-team organisations
