# Using the inbox tab on documents

Zudello makes it easy to manage email communications related to your documents. This guide explains how to view, track, and respond to emails associated with your documents directly within Zudello.

## Best practices

- Reply promptly to email messages to maintain efficient communication
- Check the Inbox tab as part of your standard document review process
- Verify the correct inbox configuration for proper email routing

## Accessing inbox messages

### Viewing the Inbox tab

1. Open the document you want to check communications for
2. Click the **Inbox** icon at the top right of the modal
3. View the complete email chain associated with this document

When viewing inbox messages, you can see:

- **From** and **To** email addresses
- Email subject
- Email body content
- Attached files
- Any Zudello documents created from attachments

If a document wasn't emailed to Zudello, you'll see a message indicating that no inbox messages were found for this resource.

## Responding to messages

To reply to an email directly from Zudello:

1. Open the document's **Inbox** tab
2. Scroll to the message box at the bottom
3. Type your message
4. Click **Send**

Your reply will be sent from the **From** email address configured for the inbox that originally received the document.
