# Inboxes in Zudello

Zudello inboxes extract documents as soon as you receive them, so you can start processing faster than ever.  Customise your inboxes names and reply to emails to suit your business.

## Understanding inboxes

When an email is received, Zudello will:

- Identify any valid documents and ignore invalid attachments like email signatures
- Move each attachment to the relevant submodule
- Begin extraction

You don't need to open the original email or tell Zudello which documents to extract. All valid documents will automatically show in the relevant submodule, and you can process them as soon as they have finished extraction.  

The email message will be visible on the document. For more information on the inbox tab, see [Using the inbox tab on documents](using-the-inbox-tab-on-documents.md).
