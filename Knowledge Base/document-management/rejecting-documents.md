# Rejecting documents

Zudello makes it easy to reject documents and send them back to suppliers or customers. You can either email rejected documents back to suppliers or simply mark them as rejected within Zudello. 

> This guide explains how to reject documents *outside of the approval process*. For information about rejecting documents during approvals, see [Approving and rejecting documents](../approval-management/approving-and-rejecting-documents.md).

## Best practices

- Review document details carefully before rejecting
- Include clear explanations in rejection emails to suppliers
- Double-check email recipients before sending
- Use consistent rejection reasons across your team

## Rejecting and emailing documents

To reject a document and email it back to the supplier:

1. Open the document you want to reject
2. Click **...** at the top of the document
3. Click **Reject**
4. Leave **Email Supplier** selected at the top
5. Select the inbox to send from
6. Verify the pre-filled supplier email address, or enter a different email
7. Add any CC recipients if needed
8. Enter an email subject and message
9. The document attaches automatically - deselect **Attach document** if you don't want to include it
10. Click **Reject and Send**

The document moves to **Rejected** status automatically. Email responses will come to the inbox from which the email was sent.

## Rejecting documents without email

To reject a document without sending an email:

1. Open the document you want to reject
2. Click **...** at the top of the document
3. Click **Reject**
4. Select **Reject but don't email** at the top
5. Click **Reject**

The document moves to Rejected status automatically.
