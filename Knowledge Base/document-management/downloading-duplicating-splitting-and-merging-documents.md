# Downloading, duplicating, splitting, and merging documents

Zudello provides several document management functions to help you process documents quickly and efficiently. This guide explains how to download, duplicate, split and merge documents.

## Downloading documents

To download a copy of the document in the original format:

1. Open the document
2. Click **...** at the top of the document
3. Click **Download**

## Duplicating documents

Duplicating creates an exact copy of a document within Zudello. Note that the attachment itself is not copied.

To duplicate a document:

1. Open the document
2. Click **...** at the top of the document
3. Click **Duplicate**

A duplicate will be created and opened in a new tab automatically.

## Splitting documents

Use document splitting when you receive multiple documents combined in a single file. For example, you may receive three separate invoices in one PDF.

To split a document:

1. Open the document
2. Click **...** at the top of the document
3. Click **Split**
4. For each individual document:
    - Enter the **From page** number
    - Enter the **To page** number
5. To add another document section, click **Add Document**
6. To remove a document section, click **X** next to the document number
7. Click **Split**

When splitting documents:

- Ensure page numbers don't overlap between documents
- Don't use the same **From page** number for multiple documents
- All pages must be included in one of the split sections

## Merging documents

Use document merging to combine separate documents into one. For example, if a supplier has sent two pages of the same invoice as individual PDFs, they can be merged. 

> Merging should not be used to merge different documents that are related, like an invoice and evidence of the work provided. For this case, use [Related documents and attachments](related-documents-and-attachments.md).

To merge documents:

1. Open the primary document
2. Click **...** at the top of the document
3. Click **Merge**
4. In the document selection window:
    - Filter documents by module and submodule if needed
    - Search for specific document numbers using the search bar
5. Select the checkbox next to each document you want to merge
6. Click **Select**

The documents return to scanning status and are scanned again as one combined document.
