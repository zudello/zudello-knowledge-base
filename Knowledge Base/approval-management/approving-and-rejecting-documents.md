# Managing document approvals

Zudello makes it easy to review and approve documents, whether you're working from your email or directly in the platform. This guide explains how to manage your approval tasks effectively.

## Best practices

- Regularly check your email and the Zudello requests submodules for any outstanding approval requests
- Review all document details carefully before approving
- Include detailed reasons when rejecting documents
- Use document chat for questions or concerns before approving or rejecting
- Verify coding information matches your organisation's requirements
- Check that supplier details match the original document
