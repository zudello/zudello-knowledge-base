# Approval history and audit trails

We know that keeping track of approval flows is essential for maintaining accountability and compliance within your organisation. This guide explains how to view, manage, and export approval history information in Zudello.

## Best practices

- Review approval histories regularly to ensure proper workflow completion
- Download and store approval histories externally for audit purposes if required
- Use the direct document links in exported histories for quick reference
- Keep approval flows expanded when actively monitoring approvals

## Viewing approval histories

Approval histories remain visible on all partially and fully approved documents. You can find the approval flow at the top left of any document with approvals. Click the arrow to collapse or expand the approval history view.
