# Approval process in Zudello

Zudello provides a consistent approval process across your organisation. This guide explains how approvals work in Zudello and how to manage them effectively.

## Understanding the approval flow

The Zudello approval process automatically assigns the appropriate approver/s to a document based on a predetermined approval flow.

When you open a document in Approval status, you'll see the approval flow at the top left. The approval flow consists of three main elements:

- Approval milestones
- Approval steps
- Approvers

### Approval milestones

Approval milestones represent distinct parts of the approval process.

Each milestone:

- Has a name to provide context 
- Contains one or more approval steps
- Shows its status through a coloured square indicator:
  - Purple: Active milestone
  - Green: Completed milestone
  - Grey: Future milestone

Milestones may appear one at a time for standalone approvals, or all at once for complex flows like DOA or management tree approvals. All steps within a milestone must be approved for the document to progress.

If a milestone is approved, it continues to the next step in processing. If a milestone is rejected, it moves to **Reject Review** status to be reviewed.

### Approval steps

Each milestone contains one or more approval steps. Each step is approved independently, but all steps in a milestone must be approved for the flow to continue.

Each approval step:

- Has a name to provide context about the current approvers
- Shows how many approvals are required to pass or fail
- Shows approval history for previously completed steps
- Shows details of any special approval actions like force approval, change of approver, or escalation
  
### Reassigning approvers

Some users will have the ability to reassign their own approvals, or all approvals, to different users. To check whether you have the permissions to change approvals, please contact your Organisation Administrator.

To change an approver:
 
1. Click the **Change User** icon next to the approver's name

2. Select the new approver from the drop-down menu

Any approver that has been manually changed will be listed under the new approver. To view any previously assigned approvers and the reason/s for the change:

5.  Click the **Others** arrow
6. Hover your mouse over the **changed** label

## Additional notes

- Documents within the approval flow appear in **Approval** status by default, though your team may have custom status configurations
- In standard Zudello document flows, rejected documents will restart the approval process if resubmitted
