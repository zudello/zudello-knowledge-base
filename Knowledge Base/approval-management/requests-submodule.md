# Requests submodule

Zudello makes it easy to stay on top of your approval tasks by consolidating all outstanding approvals into dedicated requests submodules. This guide explains how to view and manage your pending approvals efficiently.

## Best practices

- Review your approval requests regularly to prevent bottlenecks
- Action requests promptly to maintain workflow efficiency
- Check document details carefully before approving or rejecting
- Check the Requests submodule within each module that you approve documents for

## Understanding the Requests submodule

Each module in Zudello has its own Requests submodule. This layout helps you:

- Focus on approvals relevant to your current task
- Find specific approval requests quickly
- Track outstanding approvals by business area
- Maintain a clear overview of your approval responsibilities

## Viewing your approval requests

To access your pending approvals:

1. Open the relevant module (e.g. sales, purchasing, or expenses)
2. Click **Requests** in the submodule menu

3. View your list of outstanding approval requests

The Requests submodule shows only documents awaiting your approval, helping you focus on items that need your attention. Review each document carefully before approving or rejecting it. See [Approving and rejecting documents](approving-and-rejecting-documents.md) for more information on approving documents.

Once you action an approval request, it disappears from your requests submodule, helping you maintain a clean and current view of outstanding items.
