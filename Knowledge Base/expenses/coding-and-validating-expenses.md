# Coding and validating expenses

Coding and validating expenses is the next step towards getting reimbursed. This is when you enter all related information, and ensure your expenses meet your business' policies before submitting them for approval. 

This guide explains how to code and validate expense documents in Zudello, ensuring all required information is correctly entered before adding expenses to claims.

## Best practices

To ensure smooth expense processing:

- Review each expense document carefully before coding
- Double-check that extracted amounts match original receipts
- Complete all required fields based on your expense type

## Understanding expense types

Your organisation may have multiple expense types configured, each requiring different information. For example:

- Travel expenses might require journey details and purpose
- Meal expenses might require attendee information
- Equipment purchases might require asset tracking information

Select the correct expense type to ensure all necessary information is collected.

Once you've [uploaded expense documents](uploading-expenses.md), you'll need to code them to ensure all necessary information has been captured:

1. Click the expense you want to code
