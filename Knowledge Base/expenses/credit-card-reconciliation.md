# Credit card reconciliation

Zudello's credit card reconciliation feature allows you to easily verify payments on your company credit cards against expenses within Zudello. This guide explains how to reconcile credit card transactions against expenses and submit them for approval.

## Benefit of credit card reconciliation

Credit card reconciliation in Zudello offers several benefits:

- Claimants can quickly show evidence for payments on their company card
- Approvers can easily distinguish between reimbursement claims and credit card reconciliation claims
- Finance and admin users gain visibility over all company cards to ensure compliance

## Reconciling credit card payments

### Accessing the reconciliation screen

1. Click the **Expenses and Travel** module

### Understanding the reconciliation screen

The reconciliation screen has two distinct columns:

- The left side shows payments against the selected payment method. These payments are pulled through from your bank feed via a live integration.
  
- The right side shows expenses that have either been coded to the selected payment method, or do not have a payment method selected.

This layout allow you to easily compare and link payments with their related expense. 

### Linking payments with expenses

To link a payment to an expense:

1. Click and drag the payment number from the left column
2. Drop it over the expense on the right
3. The two records will be linked, and neither will be available to link anymore

To unlink a payment from an expense

1. Click the **Unlink** button on either the payment or the expense
2. The connection will be removed, and the payment and expense will be made available for linking again

### Creating a new expense for a payment

If you haven't created an expense for a particular payment:

1. Click the **+** icon next to the relevant payment
2. Choose to either:
    - Create an expense from scratch
    - Upload an expense
3. A new expense will be created and linked to the payment:

4. After saving the expense, click the **Refresh** button at the top right of the reconciliation screen

## Preparing expenses for reconciliation

Before you can complete the reconciliation:

1. All payments must be linked to an expense
2. All linked expenses must be in **Ready to reconcile** status

To move expenses into **Ready to reconcile** status:

1. Click the **Open expense** button next to the relevant expense
2. Click **Validate expense**
3. If the expense has been successfully reconciled with the payment and all required information has been filled, it will move into **Ready to reconcile** status
4. Continue to validate each expense until all have been validated and reconciled

## Completing the reconciliation

Once all payments are linked to validated expenses:

1. Click **Reconcile**
2. You'll be presented with the search or create claim screen
3. Either:
    - Search for an existing claim to add the payments to
    - Create a new claim
4. Expenses matched to payments will be automatically added to the claim
5. The payment method from the reconciliation will be automatically pre-filled
6. Submit the claim for approval as normal

## Next steps

After submitting a claim, it will enter your organisation's approval workflow. For more information on this process, see [Submitting a claim](https://claude.ai/chat/submitting-a-claim.md).
