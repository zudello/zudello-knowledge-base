# Submitting a claim

Submitting expenses as a claim allows you to group related expenses together for approval and reimbursement. This guide explains how to create claims and add expenses to them in Zudello.

## Best practices

To ensure smooth claim processing:

- Group related expenses into a single claim when possible
- Verify the correct employee is assigned to the claim
- Check that expense details match receipts before submission
