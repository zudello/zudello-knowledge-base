# Placing and sending a purchase order

Zudello's **Place order** function let's you instantly send approved purchase orders to your suppliers, without needing to switch systems. This guide explains how to place orders with or without sending emails, helping you efficiently manage your procurement process.

## Best practices

To ensure smooth order placement:

- Review purchase order details before placing
- Confirm supplier email addresses are correct
- Use inbox templates for consistent supplier communication
- Update the email message to include any special instructions or delivery requirements

## Understanding order placement

Order placement in Zudello has two key functions:

- Sending the purchase order to your supplier
- Updating the purchase order status in Zudello from **Pending** to **Placed**

This status change helps you track which orders have been sent to suppliers and which haven't, giving you greater visibility and control over your procurement flow.

## Placing an order

Only purchase orders that are in a pending-type status (e.g. the standard **Pending** status) can be placed.

3. Click **Place order**

## What happens next?

After placing an order, the order can be used to create a goods receipt, or matched to receipts or invoices that you have received from your suppliers.
