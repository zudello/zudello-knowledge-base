# Understanding two-way and three-way matching

We know that managing your purchasing process efficiently and accurately is crucial to your business. Matching is a verification process that helps you ensure you're only paying for what you ordered and received. 

This guide explains the differences between two-way and three-way matching and why your organisation might use either approach.

## Best practices

- Implement matching for all purchasing workflows where possible
- Review matched documents carefully before approval
- Address matching discrepancies in line with your business's policies
- Document your matching requirements and workflows for team training

## What is matching?

Matching is a verification process that compares documents in your procurement workflow to ensure accuracy and prevent errors or fraud. By automatically linking related documents, matching helps:

- Prevent duplicate payments
- Ensure you only pay for items you ordered
- Verify you've received what you're paying for
- Detect pricing discrepancies early

## Two-way matching

Two-way matching compares invoices against corresponding purchase orders to verify:

- The supplier is billing you for items you actually ordered
- Quantities match what was ordered
- Prices match what was agreed upon

This approach is often used for service-based purchases where there's no physical goods receipt, or when you want a streamlined verification process.

## Three-way matching

Three-way matching extends verification by comparing invoices against both purchase orders and goods receipts to ensure:

- The supplier is billing you for items you actually ordered
- Quantities match what was ordered
- Quantities match what was physically received
- Prices match what was agreed upon

This provides the most comprehensive verification and is ideal for physical goods where receipt confirmation is important.

## Benefits of automated matching

Implementing automated matching in your procurement process delivers several key advantages:

- Time savings
	- Automatic matching eliminates manual document comparison
- Error reduction
	- System verification catches discrepancies humans might miss
- Fraud prevention
	- Makes it difficult for unauthorised purchases to be paid
- Process efficiency
	- Standardises your purchasing and approval workflows
- Better supplier relationships
	- Accurate, timely payments improve vendor relations

## When to use each approach

Two-way matching works best for:

- Service-based purchases
- Situations where goods receipts aren't applicable

Three-way matching works best for:

- Physical goods purchases
- High-value transactions
- Purchases where quantity verification is critical

Many organisations use a combination of both approaches, applying the appropriate matching method based on the type of purchase.
