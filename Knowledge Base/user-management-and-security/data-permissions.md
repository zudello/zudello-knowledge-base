# Data permissions

Ensuring users can see only the information they need is crucial for your organisation's security. This guide explains how to manage data permissions to ensure users have the right level of visibility across different teams.

## Best practices

- Review data permissions regularly to ensure they align with your security requirements
- Document any significant changes to data permission settings
- Keep data permission structures as simple as possible while meeting your needs

## Understanding data permissions

Data permissions work with [User groups](user-groups.md) to control what users can see within Zudello. 

Each data permission is given access to certain resources within Zudello. Data permissions are then assigned to one or more user groups. Users within those user groups will then inherit the data permissions, giving them access to all resources selected under the data permission.
Some important things to remember are:

- Permissions are controlled at the team level
- Users can have different data permissions across different teams
- Data permissions are applied to one or more user groups
- All users who belong to a user group inherit the data permissions applied to that user group
