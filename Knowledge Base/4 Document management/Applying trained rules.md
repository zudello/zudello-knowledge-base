# Applying trained rules to documents

We know that supplier and item details can change over time. When you've made changes to these details after opening a document, you can easily reapply the updated information using the apply trained rules functionality.

## Applying trained rules

To apply trained rules to a document:

1. Click **...** at the top of the document
2. Click **Apply trained rules**
3. Wait while the document refreshes and the rules are applied
4. When a message appears saying "A new version of this Invoice is available", click **Refresh Invoice** to view the updated invoice

You can then continue processing the document as normal.

## When to apply trained rules

Apply trained rules when you have:

- Edited and saved the document, but would like to reapply supplier or item defaults
- Updated the matched supplier and would like to apply supplier defaults
- Made changes to supplier or item default settings and would like to apply them to the document

## Best practices

- Wait for the document to fully refresh after applying trained rules
- Double-check that all information has updated correctly
- Review any changes to ensure they align with your expectations
