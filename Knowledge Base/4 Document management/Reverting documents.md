# Reverting documents

We know that sometimes you need to move documents back to an editable status. This guide explains how to revert documents and what permissions are needed to do so.

## Best practices

- Only revert documents when absolutely necessary to avoid double-handling or repeated approvals
- Review document status before reverting
- Contact your organisation administrator if you need additional access
- Communicate any significant status changes to all relevant stakeholders

## Understanding document reversion

Reverting a document moves it from a non-editable status (like **Approval** or **Complete**) back to an editable status, allowing you to make necessary changes. When you revert a document, it returns to the **Ready** status.

## Required permissions

To revert a document, you need the following permissions for the document's submodule:

- Revert Approval
	- To revert documents from **Approval** status
- Revert Completed
	- To revert documents from **Completed** status
- Revery
	- To revert documents from all other non-editable statuses

Contact your organisation administrator to review your permissions.

## Reverting a document

To revert a document:

1. Open the document
2. Click **...** at the top of the document
3. Click **Revert**

The document will move to the Ready status, where you can make your changes and complete processing.
