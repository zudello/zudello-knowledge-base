## Best practices

- Review default coding settings regularly to ensure they match your business requirements
- Ensure supplier defaults are consistent between Zudello and your ERP 
- Consider the impact on existing processes before making changes

## Understanding default coding

Default coding in Zudello automatically applies predetermined values to specific transaction fields whenever:

- A document is uploaded and the supplier is successfully matched
- A supplier is manually matched to a document
- You click **Apply Trained Rules** for a document with a matched supplier

## Setting up default coding

You can configure default coding in two ways:

### ERP integration

If your ERP supports default coding rules:

1. Set up the rules in your ERP
2. Zudello pulls these rules when fetching supplier records
3. Rules are automatically saved in Zudello

To check whether supplier default coding are pulled from your ERP, contact your organisation administrator or Zudello support.

### Supplier card configuration

To set default coding directly in Zudello:

1. Open the supplier card:
    - From a document: Click **View** next to the matched supplier
    - From the **Relationships** module:
        - Click the **Supplier** submodule
        - Find and open the relevant supplier
