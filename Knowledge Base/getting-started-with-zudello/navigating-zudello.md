# Navigating Zudello

We know that new systems take some getting used to. This short guide will teach you everything you need to know about moving around Zudello, so you can start saving time straight away.

## Modules and submodules

Zudello's modules keep separate areas of your business separate, so you can focus on what's important right now. Modules are displayed at the very top of Zudello.

Within each module, submodules further organise specific record types.

Within each module, you can either click a specific submodule or click **All** to see every record within the module.
> E.g. in the purchasing module, click **Purchase Orders** to view only purchase orders or click **All** to see all purchasing documents including purchase orders, invoices, credits, and more.

## Understanding document status

Each submodule separates records by status to help you quickly identify records that need attention. For a full list and descriptions of each status, see [Document statuses](../document-management/document-statuses.md).

Focus your work by showing or hiding specific statuses. To do so:

1. Click the **Status** bar at the top right of your screen
2. Select the statuses you want to see and deselect the rest

### Using the search bar

Use the search bar to find specific records by number or reference number. The search always starts from the beginning of the field. For example, for invoice number ABC123, searching for "ABC" or "ABC123" will return the record. Searching for "123" won't return the record, and will instead return any records beginning with "123".
