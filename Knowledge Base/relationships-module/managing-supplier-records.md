# Managing supplier records

We know that maintaining accurate supplier records is crucial for your business operations. This guide explains how to effectively manage your supplier records within Zudello, whether you're creating them directly or syncing them from your ERP.

## Best practices

- Review supplier records regularly to ensure information is current
- Make all changes to supplier records in one system, either within Zudello or within your ERP
- Use consistent naming conventions for supplier codes
- Consider inactivating rather than deleting unused suppliers to maintain accurate historical records
- Verify all required fields are completed before saving

## Understanding supplier management

The suppliers submodule allows you to manage all your supplier records in one place. If you maintain supplier records in an ERP, Zudello automatically fetches and syncs this information, letting you view everything you need without switching between systems.

### Finding suppliers

To locate specific suppliers quickly:

1. Open the suppliers submodule
2. Use one of these search methods:
   - Type the supplier name or code in the search bar
   - Filter by specific criteria
   - Change your view layout
   - Sort by different fields
> For help with filtering or sorting options, see [Navigating Zudello](../getting-started-with-zudello/navigating-zudello.md).

## Managing supplier records

Before making any supplier changes, ensure that your business allows editing of suppliers within Zudello. If not, you must make changes directly within your ERP.

If you are unsure of your business's rules around maintaining supplier records, please contact your organisation administrator. 

### Viewing supplier details

To view a supplier's information:

1. Find the supplier using search or filters
2. Click the supplier record to open it
3. Review available information, which may include:
   - Legal name, trading name, and supplier code
   - Default coding settings
   - Payment information
   - Dependencies
   - Chat history
   - Audit trail
   - Related attachments

### Editing supplier records

To modify supplier information:

1. Open the supplier record
2. Make your required changes
3. Click **Save**

> If your team fetches supplier records from an ERP, any conflicting changes made in Zudello will be overwritten when the records are next fetched.

### Creating new suppliers

1. Click **New supplier**
2. Fill in all required fields
3. Click **Save and submit**

Important notes:
- The system will alert you if required fields are missing
- Depending on your organisation's settings, new suppliers may require approval

### Inactivating suppliers

Instead of deleting suppliers you no longer work with, inactivate them to preserve historical records while removing them from the supplier list on transactions.

To inactivate a single supplier:

1. Open the supplier record
2. Click the status name at the top left
3. Select **Inactive**
4. Click **Save**

To inactivate multiple suppliers:

1. Select the checkboxes next to the relevant suppliers
2. Click **Status** in the bulk actions bare at the bottom of the screen
3. Select **Inactive**
