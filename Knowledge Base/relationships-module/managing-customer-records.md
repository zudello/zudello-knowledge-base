# Managing customer records

We know that maintaining accurate customer records is crucial for your business operations. This guide explains how to effectively manage your customer records within Zudello, whether you're creating them directly or syncing them from your ERP.

## Best practices

- Review customer records regularly to ensure information is current
- Make all changes to customer records in one system, either within Zudello or within your ERP
- Use consistent naming conventions for customer codes
- Consider inactivating rather than deleting dormant accounts to maintain accurate historical records
- Verify all required fields are completed before saving

## Understanding customer management

The customers submodule allows you to manage all your customer records in one place. If you maintain customer records in an ERP, Zudello automatically fetches and syncs this information, letting you view everything you need without switching between systems.

### Finding customers

To locate specific customers quickly:

1. Open the customers submodule
2. Use one of these search methods:
    - Type the customer's name or code in the search bar
    - Filter by specific criteria
    - Change your view layout
    - Sort by different fields

> For help with filtering or sorting options, see [navigating-zudello](../getting-started-with-zudello/navigating-zudello.md).

## Managing customer records

Before making any customer changes, ensure that your business allows for the editing of customers within Zudello. If not, you must make changes directly within your ERP.

If you are unsure of your business's rules around maintaining customer records, please contact your organisation administrator.

### Viewing customer details

To view a customer's information:

1. Find the customer using search or filters
2. Click the customer record to open it
3. Review available information, which may include:
    - Legal name, trading name, and account number
    - Billing information
    - Default coding settings
    - Chat history
    - Audit trail
    - Related attachments

### Editing customer records

To modify customer information:

1. Open the customer record
2. Make your required changes
3. Click **Save**

> If your team fetches customer records from a ERP, any conflicting changes made in Zudello will be overwritten when the records are next fetched.

### Creating new customers

1. Click **New customer**
2. Fill in all required fields
3. Click **Save and submit**

Important notes:

- The system will alert you if required fields are missing
- Depending on your organisation's settings, new customers may require approval

### Inactivating customers

Instead of deleting customers you no longer work with, inactivate them to preserve historical records while removing them from active customer lists.

To inactivate a single customer:

1. Open the customer record
2. Click the status name at the top left
3. Select **Inactive**
4. Click **Save**

To inactivate multiple customers:

1. Select the checkboxes next to relevant customers
2. Click **Status** in the bulk actions bar at the bottom of the screen
3. Select **Inactive**
