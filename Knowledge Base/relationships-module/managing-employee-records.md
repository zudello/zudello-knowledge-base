# Managing employee records

We know that maintaining accurate employee records is crucial for your business operations. This guide explains how to effectively manage your employee records within Zudello, whether you're creating them directly or syncing them from your ERP system.

## Best practices

- Review employee records regularly to ensure information is current
- Make all changes to employee records in one system, either within Zudello or within your ERP
- Consider inactivating rather than deleting former employees to maintain accurate historical records
- Verify all required fields are completed before saving

## Understanding employee management

The employees submodule allows you to manage all your employee records in one place. If you maintain employee records in an ERP, Zudello may automatically fetch and sync this information, letting you view everything you need without switching between systems.

### Finding employees

To locate specific employees quickly:

1. Open the employees submodule
2. Use one of these search methods:
    - Type the employee name or ID in the search bar
    - Filter by specific criteria
    - Change your view layout
    - Sort by different fields

> For help with filtering or sorting options, see [Navigating Zudello](../getting-started-with-zudello/navigating-zudello.md).

## Managing employee records

Before making any employee changes, ensure that your business allows editing of employees within Zudello. If not, you must make changes directly within your ERP.

If you are unsure of your business's rules around maintaining employee records, please contact your organisation administrator.

### Viewing employee details

To view an employee's information:

1. Find the employee using search or filters
2. Click the employee record to open it
3. Review available information, which may include:
    - Name
    - Personal payment details for reimbursements
    - Related dimensions (such as the department or subsidiary they belong to)
    - Dependencies
    - Chat history
    - Audit trail
    - Related attachments

### Editing employee records

To modify employee information:

1. Open the employee record
2. Make your required changes
3. Click **Save**

> If your team fetches employee records from an ERP, any conflicting changes made in Zudello will be overwritten when the records are next fetched.

### Creating new employees

1. Click **New employee**
2. Fill in all required fields
3. Click **Save and submit**

Important notes:

- The system will alert you if required fields are missing
- Depending on your organisation's settings, new employees may require approval

### Inactivating employees

Instead of deleting records of employees who have left the organisation, inactivate them to preserve historical records while removing them from active employee lists.

To inactivate a single employee:

1. Open the employee record
2. Click the status name at the top left
3. Select **Inactive**
4. Click **Save**

To inactivate multiple employees:

1. Select the checkboxes next to relevant employees
2. Click **Status** in the bulk actions bar at the bottom of the screen
3. Select **Inactive**
