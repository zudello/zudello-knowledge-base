# Processing an invoice

We know that accurate and efficient invoice processing is crucial for your business operations. This guide explains how to process invoices in Zudello, from initial review through to submission for approval.

## Best practices

To ensure smooth invoice processing:

- Review the original document carefully before processing
- Check key extracted information against the original document
- Ensure all required fields and coding are completed
- Stay alert for suspicious or abnormal documents

## Processing an invoice

Processing an invoice begins with uploading the document to Zudello. For help with uploading invoices, see [[Uploading purchasing documents]].

Once an invoice has been uploaded and extracted, a user will need to:

- Code the invoice
- Allocate the invoice to a purchase order and/or goods receipt if applicable
- Submit the invoice

### Coding an invoice

To code an invoice:

1. Open the invoice
2. Review the extracted information matches the original document
3. Ensure the correct document type has been selected from the **Type** drop-down menu
4. Check header level information, including:
	- Document number
	- Date issued
	- Due date
	- Currency
5. Verify the correct supplier is matched under the **Company** section
	- If no supplier has been matched, click **Match with this supplier**
	- Select the supplier from the drop-down
6. Some or all line level fields may have been filled in by business rules
7. Complete any outstanding line line level coding by:
	- Selecting stock codes or dimensions from drop-down menus
	- Entering descriptions, quantities or prices
8. Allocate invoice lines to a purchase order and/or goods receipt if applicable (see [[Matching an invoice to a purchase order or goods receipt]])
9. Review the overall document totals
	- Check that the document total matches the original invoice
	- If line prices include tax, turn on **Are the line totals inclusive of tax?**
	- Review any document total validation errors (see [[Document validation errors]])
10. Click **Save and Submit** to submit the invoice for approval
