## Voice and tone

What is voice and tone? Zudello’s voice is a reflection of who we are. We should always sound like Zudello. At the same time, some aspects of our personality might be more or less apparent, depending on the audience and their context; that’s tone.

### Zudello’s voice

Our voice is a reflection of who we are. So who are we?

- Zudello automates business operations to liberate staff, teams, and companies to elevate their performance and productivity and achieve their full potential.
- We’re a company built by a combination of real people and the latest technology. 
	- Our real people understand our customers’ businesses and care about helping them succeed.
	- And our customers are also real people, facing human challenges, to be solved by real people.
- Our latest technology is a tool that empowers people and businesses.
- That should be clear every time someone uses our products or services.
- Most often, we show this through well-crafted tools that help people get their jobs done efficiently. But there are times when our personalities and perspectives should be more apparent. In those times, we should adapt our tone to respond to people in an appropriate and meaningful way.

### Voice guidelines

#### We inspire without over-promising

- Offer customers sincere encouragement and practical advice.
- We give advice and guidance for now, but show how it will create a positive impact in the future.

#### We simplify and solve complex problems without being aloof, arrogant, or demeaning

- We speak simply as well. We use short words, short sentences, and short paragraphs.
- We speak clearly and succinctly, without being blunt or bossy.
- Be professional but not stiff, formal or jargonistic.

#### We are business first, technology second

- We understand how businesses work and what business people need.
- We understand local compliance, regulatory, and tax needs.
- Talk about business benefits that the technology can enable, rather than just the tech.
- Be specific when explaining benefits without making things sound better than they are.

#### We are empathic and considerate, but not patronising or hand-holding

- Show people the “why” and “how” behind actions—don’t just tell them “what’ to do.
- Use examples or visuals to show that we understand their pain and the benefits we can bring.

#### We are professional, but not stiff and formal

- We are experienced, but not old, tired, nostalgic or world weary.
- We are proud, but not arrogant.
- We relate as easily to a CFO as we do to a junior data-entry clerk.
- We’re ready, willing, and able, but not gung-ho or impulsive. 

#### We are proactive, but not nosey or pushy

- We apply “active listening” when talking to customers.
- We listen first, clarify, then probe and explore.
- We ask the right questions.
- We put customers’ needs ahead of our desire to fix things our way.

#### We surprise in a pleasant and positive way

- We take hated, manual, menial tasks and make them disappear.
- We create efficiencies that open up endless professional opportunities.
- We are magical, but not sneaky, illusory, or mystical.
- We offer the gift of time: time to achieve, time to grow, and time to excel.

## Active vs passive voice

Write in the active voice:

> **Subject** (person/thing acting) <u>verb</u> (the action) *object* (receives the action)

**The active voice** has the subject taking the initiative, performing the action, and (usually) achieving a result. 

> e.g. **Zudello** (subject) <u>makes</u> (strong, present tense verb) *manual data entry* (object) a thing of the past (result).  ✅

**The passive voice** has the object being acted upon **by** a subject. It makes the object of the sentence appear to lack agency and seem weak and submissive. The subject is relegated to the end of the sentence.

> e.g. *Manual data entry* (object) <u>has been made</u> (weak, past tense, compound verb) a thing of the past by **Zudello** (subject). ❌

Signs of passive voice:

- Object before subject (e.g., "the item was purchased by the customer")
- Past tense verbs ("was added", "was created")
- Forms of "to be" ("was", "is", "were")
- The word **by** is often found in passive sentences.

Use passive voice only when:

- Avoiding referring to yourself or Zudello
- Making clear you didn't personally take an action
- The object is more important than the subject

> e.g.
> Invoices are created monthly and emailed to mark.li@email.com ✅
> 
> Zudello creates and emails your invoices monthly to simon.r@email.com ❌

## Grammar and mechanics

### Language

- British English

###  Plain language

- Use words your users use
- Keep sentences short with a single focus
- Aim for a high school reading level
- Don’t use technical jargon or complex terminology

### Contractions

Use contractions for a casual tone, except when they sound awkward:

- You **can't** have products with negative prices ✅
- Your products **don't** have units of measure ✅
- An error occurred and your changes **couldn't** be saved ✅
- **There're** 10 products in this collection ❌
- You **gotta** select a submodule before uploading a document ❌
- This order **needn't** be approved ❌

### Capitalisation 

The two types of capitalisation that Zudello uses are title case and sentence case. Details of each case, and when to use them (the case for each case, if you will) can be found below: 
#### Title Case 

To use title case: 

- Begin major words with a capital letter, including nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs 
- Do not capitalise articles like 'a', 'an', or 'the' unless they begin or end the title 
- Do not capitalise prepositions like 'in', 'to' or 'from' 
- Do not capitalise conjunctions like 'and' or 'or' 
- Always capitalise the first and last word, regardless of their function 

#### Sentence Case 

To use sentence case: 

- Capitalise the first word 
- Capitalise proper/trademarked nouns 
- Lowercase everything else 

#### Within the Zudello UI 

The following rules apply for the Zudello UI only. For all other documentation and communication, follow the rules from the Headings section onwards. 

Use title case for: 

- Headers (modules, submodules)
- Headers for modals or popups that require more than a confirmation action (e.g. where users are selecting from a drop-down or entering information)
- Sidebars 
- Toolbars 
- Section titles 
- Table column headers
- Statuses 

Use sentence case for: 

- Buttons and toggles
- Headers for confirmation pop-ups (e.g. the popup asking to confirm deletion of a record)
- Field names, including drop-downs
- Field placeholders 
- System messages, regardless of length

### Within documentation

Use title case for:

- Titles
- Products or features that are unique to Zudello and marketable as their own product
- When describing the Zudello “Platform”, use a capital P

Use sentence case for:

- Everything else (including all headings)
- Don't capitalise generic features

#### Referencing system buttons and functions

- Match case formatting exactly and use bold when directly referencing buttons, toggles, drop-down menus or specific options in drop-down menus. 
- Don’t capitalise or bold when referencing variable options  
    e.g. Scroll down on the sidebar, and click **Datasets** ✅  
    Select **Invoices** from the drop-down menu ✅  
    Select the relevant module from the **Module** drop-down ✅  
    Click the **Dataset** you want to edit ❌
- Don't capitalise the name of system functions, areas, or items
	- Select the purchase order that you want to match to the invoice ✅
	- Bulk updates can be performed using the importing feature ✅
	- Quotes should be uploaded into the **Purchasing** module ❌

### Statuses

- Match case formatting exactly and use bold when directly referencing statuses
- Don't bold or capitalise the word 'status'  
	- The invoice will move to **Completed** status ✅   
	- Select the checkbox next to each status you would like to view ✅  
	- This will filter to the **Status** you selected ❌  
	- Purchase orders start in **Draft** **Status** ❌

#### Job titles

- Capitalise when before/after person's name
- Don't capitalise when referring to role without name
	- Chief Executive Officer, Neville Woller ✅  
	- Contact your organisation administrator for assistance ✅  
	- The document will be escalated to the Chief Financial Officer ❌

### Log in vs login

- Log in (two words) is a verb phrase - it's what you do when you enter your credentials to access an account:
	- I need to log in to my email  ✅ 
	- Please log in to continue  ✅ 
	- You will need to login again ❌
- Login (one word) is a noun or adjective - it refers to the credentials or the process itself:
	- The login page isn't loading  ✅ 
	- Enter your login details below  ✅ 
	- If you have forgotten your log in information ❌
- An easy way to remember; if you can replace it with ‘sign in’, use two words (log in). If you can replace it with ‘username’ or ‘credentials’, use one word (login).

### Toggles and radio buttons

- Refer to toggles and radio buttons as options only if required. Otherwise, just use the name of the toggle/button.
- Options are either turned on or turned off (not enabled, selected, toggled off, or anything else).
	- Turned on, turn on, turning on, turns on.
- Bold the name of an option like you would a button.
- Examples:
	- Turn on the Delegate duties option ✅ 
	- Turn off Are the line totals inclusive of tax? ✅ 
	- Disable the Verify email option ❌

### Checkboxes 

- Refer to checkboxes as the name of the option if the name is less than 3 words and each name is unique. Otherwise, refer to them as checkboxes.    
- If using the name of the option, bold the name and match the case in the UI.
- Checkboxes are selected or deselected, not turned on, toggled off, unchecked, or enabled.
	- Select, selected, selecting, selects
	- Deselect, deselected, deselecting, deselects
- Examples:
	- Select Ready, User Review and any other statuses you would like to view ✅ 
	- Select the checkbox at the start of each row that you would like to delete ✅ 
	- Check Approval to view only invoices awaiting approval ❌
	- Select Step Name at the start of each dataset row you want to delete ❌

### Drop-down menus

- Drop-down, not drop down or dropdown.
- Users select options from a drop-down menu. They don't pick, choose, or click.**

### Lists

#### Bulleted Lists

Use a bulleted list when items are related, but sequence or priority doesn’t matter. For three or more items in a list, don’t use sentence case; use a bulleted list instead:

- Introduce with full sentence and colon
- Capitalise the first word of the bullet
- Use punctuation on all bullets if one requires it
- Don’t add 'and' after the penultimate (second last) list item
- Don’t mix single words and sentences in the same list
- Use nested bullet points for lists with explanations
- Step name
	- Displays the name that will appear on each approval step when documents are sent for approval ✅
- Don't use colons, semicolons, or dashes for nested lists or explanations
- Step name: Displays the name that will appear on each approval step when documents are sent for approval ❌
- Step name - Displays the name that will appear on each approval step when documents are sent for approval ❌

#### Numbered Lists

For sequential or priority-based items, use a numbered (ordinal) list, starting at 1. 
Apply the same grammar rules as per bulleted list.
